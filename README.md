## Overview

![screenshot](/404-not-found-master/2023-03-27_13-50-32.gif)

> This repository is for a project I completed for [Devchallenges.io](http://devchallenges.io), where I deployed my demo to [surge.sh](https://surge.sh/) server Then by doing this I am able to used a modern way of resizing fonts using the `clamp()` property. This approach is efficient for responsive web design, as it allows you to change the font size without having to worry about the browser being unable to render text at certain point sizes.

> The mobile-first approach is the approach I use with this project. I’ve used `mid-width` with media queries to make sure all of my pages are responsive, and they’re all in a format that will work on both desktop and mobile devices.

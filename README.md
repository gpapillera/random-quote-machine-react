<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](/Untitled.gif)

> The project I worked on for [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine) is stored in this repository. I used [github-pages](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages) to host my demo. I can then learn some of the fundamentals of React.dev by doing this. React is a powerful and adaptable JavaScript toolkit for creating user interfaces. It simplifies complicated UIs into discrete units of code known as "components." React is limited to what you see on a website's home page by the use of these components.

> With this project, I started with the desktop. To ensure that all of my pages are responsive and in a format that would operate on both desktop and mobile devices, I used the `clamp()`, `min()`, and `max()` properties to address its responsiveness.

### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- IDE: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a submission to a [Front End Development Libraries](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) project. The [project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.

- [x] **User Story #1**:\
  I can see a wrapper element with a corresponding `id="quote-box"`.

- [x] **User Story #2**:\
  Within `#quote-box`, I can see an element with a corresponding `id="text"`.

- [x] **User Story #3**:\
  Within `#quote-box`, I can see an element with a corresponding `id="author"`.

- [x] **User Story #4**:\
  Within `#quote-box`, I can see a clickable element with a corresponding `id="new-quote"`.

- [x] **User Story #5**:\
  Within `#quote-box`, I can see a clickable a element with a corresponding `id="tweet-quote"`.

- [x] **User Story #6**:\
  On first load, my quote machine displays a random quote in the element with `id="text"`.

- [x] **User Story #7**:\
  On first load, my quote machine displays the random quote's author in the element with `id="author"`.

- [x] **User Story #8**:\
  When the `#new-quote` button is clicked, my quote machine should fetch a new quote and display it in the `#text` element.

- [x] **User Story #9**:\
  My quote machine should fetch the new quote's author when the `#new-quote` button is clicked and display it in the `#author` element.

- [x] **User Story #10**:\
  I can tweet the current quote by clicking on the `#tweet-quote` a element. This a element should include the `"twitter.com/intent/tweet"` path in its href attribute to tweet the current quote.

- [x] **User Story #11**:\
  The `#quote-box` wrapper element should be horizontally centered. Please run tests with browser's zoom level at 100% and page maximized.
